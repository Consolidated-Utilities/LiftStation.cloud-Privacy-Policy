## Overview

The LiftStation.cloud software suite consists of an iOS and Android app used to collect data, an API that validates and stores the data in a database, and a web application that generates Excel reports and allows an organization to add, remove or edit users, lift stations, wells and routes. 

The data collected by the software is the bare minimum needed to function. No location data is collected or stored. No IP Addresses are stored. This document will give an overview of data collected.
